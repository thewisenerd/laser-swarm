\subsubsection{Problem statement \& approach}
\label{Probstat}

As was stated in the introduction, the goal of this project is to determine the technical feasibility of a constellation of satellites with one satellite emitting high frequency, low energy laser and the other satellites receiving the reflected photons.

To determine the technical feasibility of the laser swarm concept, several aspects have been studied:

\begin{itemize}
\item Orbits: Which altitude is optimal? Which satellite formation is optimal?
\item Attitude and pointing: Which pointing accuracy is required? How can it be achieved?
\item Communication: Which communication architecture is optimal?
\item Synchronisation and localisation: Which time and position accuracy is required? How can it be achieved?
\item Photon budget: How powerful does the laser need to be? How efficiently can the photons be detected? What will the signal to noise ratio be?z
\item Slope determination \& BRDF: Is it possible to extract BRDF and slope from the received information?
\end{itemize}

The approach for this project is twofold: a detailed design was made in which all all foreseeable issues are addressed and software was written to predict the signal received based on the choices made in the detailed design.

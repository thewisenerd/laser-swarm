\section{Production and Logistics}
\label{SSPRO}

During the design it was chosen to have one unique satellite, containing the laser emitter and large data storage system, and eight smaller identical satellites which contain the photon receivers. This allows for series production which is more efficient than one single large satellite: less unique components, parallel production possible, procedures can be reused. This also implies that the number of different spare parts could be reduced. Smaller satellites can also use smaller facilities for production and testing. 

In previous reports piggy back launches were considered for several reasons, but because of the high number of satellites it was deemed more practical to use a dedicated launcher as the total mass still allowed for a small launcher such as the Soyuz.

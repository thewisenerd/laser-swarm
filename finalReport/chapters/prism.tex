\subsection{Prism design}
\label{prism}
Prism is quite important after the receiver's second parabolic to filter out all the noisy light except wavelength at 472[nm] to 474[nm]. The prism design contains glass material, the prism angle and incoming light angle. The general prism looks like:

In figure \ref{prism2D} on page \ref{prism2D}, the outgoing angle $\epsilon$ can be calculated using the formula:

The main key requirement to design the prism is to maximize the

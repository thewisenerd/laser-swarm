\label{MissionApproachIntro}

The \ac{FLAMeS} mission consists of nine satellites in six different orbits, these satellites consist of two types. The first is called the emitter satellite, because it carries the laser payload (emitting payload). The second type is the receiver satellites, earning the name by only have a receiving payload. Unless clarity poses a problem these satellites a referred to as simply the emitter and receiver.

This chapter will show a function overview of the mission and how different systems of the satellite cooperate to ensure a successful mission. First the functional flow diagram is discussed in section \ref{section_FFD} and the functional breakdown structure follows in section \ref{section_FBS} on page \pageref{section_FBS}. After that the hardware block diagram and software block diagram are discussed in section \ref{section_HWBD} on page \pageref{section_HWBD} and section \ref{section_SWBD} on page \pageref{section_SWBD} respectively. Section \ref{EBD} shortly discusses the electrical block diagram and section \ref{DHBD} on page \pageref{DHBD} handles the data handling block diagram for the emitter satellite and the receiver satellite. The final part of this chapter treats the communications flow diagram on page \pageref{CFD} in section \ref{CFD}.

One way to maximize efficiency is to make sure that everybody has a clear cut task. Therefore a resource allocation was performed. The results can be ssen in section \ref{DDHR}. Budget breakdowns are a good tool to know the total budgets in terms of mass, cost and power. When these are made it is easy to quickly check up and see what the mass, cost or power usage of each component is. The individual breakdowns are given in sections \ref{DDMBB}, \ref{DDCB} for the cost and maas budget breakdown. The power usage breakdown for the emitter can be found in section \ref{emitter_EPS} and that for the receiver in section \ref{receiver_EPS}.
Section \ref{OperationsLogistics} discusses the operation and logistic aspect of the mission in detail.
The mission lifetime extends far beyond these ten weeks. The timeline of this mission can be seen in the Gantt chart in section \ref{frPMgantt}.

\section{End of Life}
\label{SSEOL}

Each satellite will be at the end of its life if it cannot perform its function anymore.
It is important that after the mission is over all satellites are removed from their orbit and burn up in the atmosphere so that they do not pose any danger to other satellites.
Final decommissioning of the swarm will be more complex than for a regular satellite, since every individual satellite has to be decommissioned separately.

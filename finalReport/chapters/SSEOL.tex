\section{End of Life}
\label{SSEOL}

Each satellite will be at the end of its life if its payload fails or if the amount of propellant is nearing depletion.
It is important that after the mission is over all satellites are removed from their orbit and burn up in the atmosphere so that they do not pose any danger to other satellites.
Final decommissioning of the swarm will be more complex than for a regular mission with one single satellite, since each satellite has to be decommissioned separately.
Since a centralized architecture was chosen, in which all communication flows through the emitter satellite, there was the possibility that the other satellites could not be decommissioned when that emitter satellite failed. This is why an extra Earth facing antenna was added to the other satellites which can be used to create a backup link.

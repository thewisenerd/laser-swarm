\section{Electrical Block Diagram}
\label{EBD}

The electrical block diagrams show the architecture of the \ac{EPS} of the receiver and the emitter satellites. Detailed information about the block diagrams and the block diagrams themselves can be found in sections \ref{emitter_EPS} and \ref{receiver_EPS} for the emitter and receiver satellites respectively.

The electrical block diagram of the emitter satellite can be seen in figure \ref{fig:emitter_block} on page \pageref{fig:emitter_block} and that of the receiver satellites can be seen in figure \ref{fig:receiver_block} on page \pageref{fig:receiver_block}.

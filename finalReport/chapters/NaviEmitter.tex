\label{NaviEmitter}

For navigation the receiver satellites are considered first to find the smallest required size of the \acs{GPS} receiver. However the system chosen there has an accuracy that is high enough to warrant its usage onboard the emitter satellite as well.

For convenience the chosen system is repeated here. The chosen system is a \acs{GPS} receiver developed by SpaceQuest called the GPS-12-V1, it has a real-time accuracy of at least ten meters and a post-processing accuracy up to several millimeters. The \acs{GPS} antenna used is one developed by \ac{SSTL} and is a SGR Patch Antenna ASY-00741-04. For further reference please go to section \ref{NaviReceiver} on page \pageref{NaviReceiver}.

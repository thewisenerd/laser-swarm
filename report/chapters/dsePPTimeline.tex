\section{Time line}
\label{dsePPTimeline}
The Gantt chart that can be seen in Appendix \ref{ganttchart}
shows the time line of the DSE project.
As can be seen there are four phases. 

The first phase is the start-up of the project. Here time is taken to get to know the project and
determine the tasks to be done. Also a team organization is created and a time line is made.
The second phase contains the start of the design of the system. The different subsystems are looked 
at individually to better fulfill the requirements. Different design options will be considered.
At the same time the risk assessment, RAMS characteristics and return on development will be investigated.
During the third phase, three concrete design options will be chosen. Their designs will be elaborated further.
At the end, a trade-off will be performed according to certain trade-off criteria.
The chosen design will be worked out completely in the last phase. Each subsystem will be completely designed
and integrated into the full design. Lastly the feasibility of the system will be evaluated.

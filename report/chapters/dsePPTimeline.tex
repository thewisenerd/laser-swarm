\section{Timeline}
\label{dsePPTimeline}
The Gantt chart that can be seen in Appendix \ref{ganttchart}
shows the time line of the DSE project.
As can be seen there are four phases. 

The first phase is the start-up of the project. Time is taken here to get to know the project and to
determine the tasks to be done. A team organization is also created and a timeline is made.
The second phase contains the start of the design of the system. The different subsystems are looked 
at individually to better fulfill the requirements. Different design options will be considered.
At the same time the risk assessment, Reliability Availability Maintainability and Safety (RAMS) characteristics and return on investment will be investigated.

During the third phase, three concrete design options will be chosen. Their designs will be elaborated on further.

At the end, a trade-off will be performed according to certain trade-off criteria.
The chosen design will be worked out completely in the last phase. Each subsystem will be completely designed
and integrated into the full system. Lastly the feasibility of the system will be evaluated.

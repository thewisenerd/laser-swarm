\label{dsePPRequirements}
The system is based on a single nadir-pointing low-power Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) emitter satellite with a swarm of receiver satellites. Because of the low power of the laser signal the receivers need to be directed to the point where the laser signal is reflected. The photon detection performance of the system needs to be better than the performance of a comparable system with a single receiver on the same satellite as the transmitter.

\label{dsePPRequirements}
In this section a short overview is given of the requirements for the mission. The system is based on a single nadir-pointing low-power LIght Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) emitter satellite with a swarm of receiver satellites in the vicinity of the emitter. The low power of the laser signal the receivers need to point to the point the laser signal is reflected. The photon detection performance of the system needs to be better than the performance of a comparable system with a single receiver on the same satellite as the transmitter.

Once in orbit, its influence on the Earth is very limited, the only real concern is the debris it leaves behind during launch and deployment, which can be dangerous to other satellites if the debris stays in orbit.
However, the deployment mechanisms, which are solely responsible for the debris, are not included in this technical feasibility study. Later studies continuing on this feasibility study should keep an eye on it, since more satellites could mean more deployment mechanisms and hence more debris.
One aspect that can be dealt with is the efficient use of resources, the swarm can be designed in such a way that if one of the satellites fails a replacement satellite can be sent and the other still working satellites can be reused.

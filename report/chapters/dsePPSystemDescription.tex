\section{System Description}
\label{dsePPSystemDescription}
The system under consideration for this project consists of a single LiDAR emitter satellite surrounded by a swarm of receivers. This system may replace the current system of bulky high energy lasers with large receiver telescopes. Contrary to the current system the swarm uses a high frequency, low energy laser combined with a lot of small, very sensitive, receivers in an orbit near the emitter. The receivers have to be able to distinguish single photons that reflect back from the Earth surface. This data is then used to reconstruct the topology of the scanned area.

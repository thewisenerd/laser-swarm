\section{System Description}
\label{dsePPSystemDescription}
The system under consideration for this project consits of a single LiDAR emitter satellite surrounded by a swarm of receivers. This system may replace the current system of bulky high energy lasers with large receiver telescopes. Contrary to that system the swarm uses a high frequency low energy laser combined with lot of small, very sensitive receivers in an orbit near the emitter. The receivers have to be able to distinguish up to single photons that reflect back from the Earth surface. With this data obtained from the swarm the topology of the scanned area is reconstructed.

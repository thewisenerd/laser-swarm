\section{Human Resource Allocation}
\label{blHR}
The first part of the project will involve a team of five specialists designing the five critical subsystems and one person designing the orbits of the swarm. The other four members will concentrate on the development of the software that will be used to assist the trade-off and verify the design. At later stages, some of the the software engineering personnel will be heavily involved in designing proper algorithms for the processing of mission data, while others will be brought in to assist with detail design. 

A schematic representation of the resource allocation can be found in figure \ref{fig:blBBHR} on page \pageref{fig:blBBHR}.

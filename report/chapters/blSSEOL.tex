\section{End Of Life}
\label{blSSEOL}

Each satellite will be at the end of its life it can't perform its function anymore or if its onboard propellant is low.
It is important that after the mission is over no satellites are removed from space and burn up in the atmosphere so that they don't pose any danger to other satellites.
Final decommissioning of the swarm will be more complex than for a regular satellite, since every individual satellite has to be decommissioned separately.

\section{Introduction}
\label{dsePPIntro}
The goal of this Design Synthesis Exercise is to design a constellation of satellites, consisting of one low-power LiDAR emitter and several photon counting receivers. Existing system mainly consist of single platforms, which are too large and too expensive, and require very precise and powerful instruments to acquire any form of useful data. The purpose of this project is to asses the possibility of reducing operational and manufacturing costs of satellite laser altimetry as well as increasing the accuracy of the processed data.

As part of the DSE, the primary goal of the project planning document is to describe the tasks and allocation of resources of the project group in the proper context. Through the use of appropriate System Engineering and Project Management concepts, a detailed plan is established.

The rest of this chapter will describe the project in general and specify the requirements of the system. The following chapter contains the Project Management information such as the Work Flow Diagrams, Work Breakdown Structure, human resource information and time allocation breakdown.

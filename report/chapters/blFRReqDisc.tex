\section{Requirement Discovery Tree}
\label{dlRDT}
The requirement discovery process begins with the restatement of the mission need statement. From there, the top level requirements and their derivatives can be analysed.
\subsection{Mission Need Statement}
\label{dsePPMNS}
Demonstrate that a satellite constellation, consisting of a single emitter and several receivers, will perform superior (in terms of cost and lifetime) to existing spaceborne laser altimetry systems.
\subsection{Requirement Discovery}
\label{dlReqDesq}
From the mission need statement in section \ref{dsePPMNS} it possible to deduce the top level requirements of this project.

In the market breakdown diagram, each data type has both science and commercial potential customers. For example in science field, the oceanographic data can be used to do some climate researches. Scientist can study the evolution of weather patterns from the ocean system by modeling changes in the distribution of heat in the ocean. On the other hand in commercial field, maps of current, eddies and vector winds are used in commercial shipping and recreational yachting to optimize routes. All the blocks in the diagram could be potential benefits in the future.

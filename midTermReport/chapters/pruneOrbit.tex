\section{Orbit Characteristics}
\label{pruneOrbit}
The orbits are determined depending on the characteristics of the payload. Because the payload uses a low power laser this means that the orbits will have to be \ac{LEO} in order for the laser to get any photons to the receivers. The resulting design option tree can be found in figure \ref{fig:pruneOrbit}, page \pageref{fig:pruneOrbit}. Further pruning is not possible without a detailed analysis of the remaining options --- which will take place in the tradeoff.

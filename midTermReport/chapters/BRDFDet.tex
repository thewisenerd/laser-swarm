\section{Bidirectional Reflection Density Function Determination}
\label{BRDFDet}
The \ac{BRDF} returns the ratio of the radiance to irradiance for a given angle perpendicular to the surface. In theory, it is possible to measure it by means of the received photons of all of the receivers for a given pulse, where each received photon indicates the relative intensity. From the position of the receivers the direction of the irradiance vector can be calculated.  Having the direction and intensity of the reflected radiation a segment of the \ac{BRDF} for a specific incident angle could be reconstructed.  By making a multiple passes over the same region, a partial \ac{BRDF} for different incidence angles can be recorded. If the data is interpolated, a complete \ac{BRDF} can be determined.

As part of the laser swarm feasibility study, this document preliminarily describes the design and workings of a software tool used to simulate the laser swarm's behavior. The software tool simulates a satellite swarm consisting of a single \ac{LiDAR} emitter and multiple receivers flying in formation for the purpose of mapping the Earth's surface. The software tool is required to reconstruct a model of the Earth's surface as well as the scattering characteristics of the terrain.\\\\
This document discusses the actual simulation as well as the data processing taking place afterwards.

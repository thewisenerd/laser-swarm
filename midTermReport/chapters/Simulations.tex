In order to determine the correct sizing of various subsystems, the behavior of the swarm needs to be known. To this purpose several simulations have been ran. The first and most important one is to determine the variation of the photon count with increasing altitude. This is simulation is described in section \ref{sec:VariationOfPhotonDensity} on page \pageref{sec:VariationOfPhotonDensity}. In section \ref{sec:SolarPhotonsFraction} on page \pageref{sec:SolarPhotonsFraction}, second simulation is discussed. This simulation determines the amount of noise photons received from the sun with respect to the number of photons from the \ac{laser} emitter.

\subsection{Earth Model}
\label{earthModel}

The Earth model is the digital representation of the Earth surface. It stores a \ac{DEM}, and the
scattering characteristics of the local terrain. In section \ref{DEM}, the \ac{DEM} implementation
will be elaborated and section \ref{scatter} describes the way incoming radiation is scattered.

The first month of this project has already passed, and this mid term report indicates and important milestone. We're not there yet, but we are getting on with it.

We did not, however, do everything by ourselves, and this is a good place to thank those who have been so kind as to give us some of their precious time.

First I want to mention professor Edoardo Charbon, who kindly explained and showed to us the workings of his \ac{SPAD}\footnote{See \cite[98-105]{SPADThesis}, \cite{SPAD2} and \cite{SPAD3}}: without his help we would be hopelessly in the dark on these fascinating devices. From this place I also want to thank professor Kourosh Khoshelham for helping us to some valuable material on remote sensing. I also want to thank Jasper Bouwmeester, who provided us with some helpful information on solar panel pricing.

And finally I thank our tutor, professor Ben Gorte, who was very generous to us with his time and has been very supportive of the entire project.\\\\
I hope you will have as much fun reading this report, as we had in making it!\\\\
Yours sincerely,\\\\\\\\

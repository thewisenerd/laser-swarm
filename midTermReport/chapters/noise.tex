\section{Noise Introduction}
\label{noise}

The main source of noise in the system is from the earth surface. This includes sources on
the earth (eg. lights on the highways) or reflected radiation (eg. Earth albedo). The amount of
radiation that is received by the receivers depends on the footprint of the  receivers. This is an
ellipse created by the intersection of the cone originating in the receiver with the terrain. A
simplification is made that the \ac{DEM} is assumed to be a flat area with the elevation of the
center point.
 
The amount of power emitted per square meter is dependant on the illumination of the sun. If the sun
illuminates the footprint, the emitted power is the reflected power of the sun (in the receiver
detection wavelength bandwidth). This power can be deduced by ?Plancks law?. If the sun does not
illuminate the receiver footprint, then a simple base value is used to represent the emittance by the earth.

During the noise propagation trough the atmosphere, the noise is also attenuated. This atenuation is
computed in the same manner as for the signal (see section \ref{signPath}).

Once in orbit, the satellite's influence on the Earth is very limited. The only real concern is the debris it leaves behind during launch and deployment, which can be dangerous to other satellites orbiting the Earth.
However, the deployment mechanism , which is responsible for most of the debris, is not included in this technical feasibility study. Later studies developing the ideas from this feasibility study should take it into account, since more satellites could mean more deployment mechanisms and hence more waste.
One aspect that can be dealt with is the efficient use of resources. The swarm can be designed in such a way that if one of the satellites fails a replacement satellite can be sent, whilst any remaining satellites can be reused.

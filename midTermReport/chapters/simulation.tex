\label{simulation}
In this chapter the simulation of the satellites moving through space and sending and receiving laser pulses is discussed. In section \ref{orbit} the emitter and receiver satellite orbits are considered. In section \ref{earthModel} the way the Earth's surface was modeled is explained. In section \ref{signPath} the path of the signal is examined, whereas in section \ref{noise} the introduction of noise into the signal is disclosed.

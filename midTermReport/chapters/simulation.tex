\section{Simulation}
\label{simIntro}
In this section the simulation of the satellites, moving through space and sending and receiving laser pulses, is discussed. In subsection \ref{orbit} the emitter and receiver satellite orbits are considered. In subsection \ref{earthModel} the way the Earth's surface was modeled is explained. In subsection \ref{signPath} the path of the signal is examined, whereas in subsection \ref{noise} the introduction of noise into the signal is disclosed.

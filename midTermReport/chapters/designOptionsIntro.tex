\chapter{Design Options}
\label{designOptions}

In this chapter the design options are repeated from the baseline report. This is done so that the reader gets the whole picture from options to the design finally chosen. This is done for the \ac{ADCS}, the telecommunications subsystem, the \ac{EPS}, the orbits, the \ac{OEP} and the \ac{ORP}, in subsections \ref{designOptionsADCS} to \ref{designOptionsReceiver}. The full text has not been included, and the diagrams have been moved to appendix \ref{designOptionsDiagrams}.

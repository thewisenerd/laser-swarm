The first subsystem to be discussed is the \acl{AODCS} in section \ref{aodcs}, after that the communications system is analyzed in section \ref{mtrTOCOM}. Then the \acl{EPS} is treated in section \ref{TO_EPS} which is followed by three chapters concerning orbit design. Section \ref{AnalOrb} explores special types of orbit, the next section (\ref{mtrOrbAltitude}) concerns the determination of the altitude, and the final section (\ref{mtrSwarmDesign}) is concerned with the design of the satellite formation. The next two sections are about optical sensing (\ref{Optical_emitter_receiver}) and receiver pointing (\ref{RecPoint}) respectively. Finally section summarizes the design choices to form the final preliminary design.

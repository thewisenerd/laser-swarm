\section{Final Design}
After all trade-offs are done a final preliminary design can be compiled. 

The system will contain:
\begin{itemize}
\item {A Neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser for the emitter satellite}
\item {\ac{SPAD} receivers with dedicated mirrors for receiver satellites}
\item {A pointing mechanism using a stepper motor and a reaction wheel}
\item {Sun sensors and a star tracker for attitude determination}
\item {Reaction wheels and magneto torquers for attitude control}
\item {Thin film Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) solar cells}
\item {A X-band downlink with a phased array}
\item {A S-band uplink}
\item {A Ku-band cross-link with a horn antenna}
\item {A \ac{GPS} receiver for tracking}
\item {A centralised communication structure}
\end{itemize}

The satellites will have a circular orbit (eccentricity = 0), with an inclination of 85${}^\circ$ and an altitude of 500km. The right ascending node will vary for the different satellites.

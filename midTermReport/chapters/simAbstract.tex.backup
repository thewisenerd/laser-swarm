\begin{abstract}
As part of a laser swarm feasibility study, this document preliminarily describes the design and workings of a simulator. This simulator simulates a satellite swarm with a single emitter and multiple receivers flying in formation for the purpose of mapping the Earth's surface. The how and why of the simulator is discussed in this document.

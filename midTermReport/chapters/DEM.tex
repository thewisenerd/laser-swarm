\subsection{\acl{DEM}}
\label{DEM}

A \acl{DEM} is the digital representation of the topographic surface. For the ground representation
in the simulator, a few tiles of the ASTER \ac{GDEM} are used. This \ac{DEM} was created using the
the complete history of the ASTER instrument launched on Terra satellite. This \ac{DEM} has a
spatial resolution of one arc-second and a vertical accuracy of 7 $\sim$ 14m. The elevations of the
intermediate point where obtained using nearest-neighbor interpolation.

The ASTER \ac{GDEM} elevations are expressed with respect to the WGS84 ellipsoid. To simplify the
internal simulator, the \ac{DEM} tiles were reprojected to a spheroid (EPSG:3857). The reprojection
is done using the GeoTools Java toolkit \cite{geotools}.

The digital elevation is used to compute total distance (and thus time) that the laser pulse
travels. Furthermore, because scattering is dependant on the terrain normal, also this normal is
derived form the \ac{DEM}. This normal is derived from the two perpendicular surface gradients that
can extracted from the \ac{DEM}.

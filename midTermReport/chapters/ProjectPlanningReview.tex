\section{\acl{WFD}}
\label{WFD}
The tasks to be done on the simulator have been updated and presented in more detail. Some tasks have also been 
changed in the \ac{WFD}: they now start earlier or later so as to better describe the work flow of the project. 
The tasks in the green and blue boxes respectively describe the simulator design finalization and tradeoff execution in more detail. Red boxes are tasks which are explicitly needed for the \ac{MTR}. The updated \ac{WFD} of the \ac{MTR} is given in figure \ref{fig:WFmidterm2}, page \pageref{fig:WFmidterm2}.

The \ac{WFD} of the final report have also been updated. In retrospect, a very important part if the final report was not 
present in the \ac{WFD}: perfecting the design and the feasibility determination. Now these tasks have been added
to the daigram to make it complete. As with the \ac{WFD} of the \ac{MTR}, all boxes in red are explicitly required
for the final report. The diagram can be seen in figure \ref{fig:WFfinal2}, page \pageref{fig:WFfinal2}.

\section{\acl{WBS}}
\label{WBS}
The \ac{WBS} has been updated like the work flow diagrams. Some extra and other more detailed tasks
defined in the \ac{WFD} have also been added to these structures. Also, the layout has been changed somewhat to improve readability and correctness. The updated \ac{WBS}s can be seen in figures \ref{fig:WBmidterm2} and \ref{fig:WBfinal2}, starting on page \pageref{fig:WBmidterm2}.

\section{Gantt chart}
\label{Gantt}
As the \ac{WFD} and the \ac{WBS} have been updated, so the Gantt chart has also been updated. 
Now that we are further along in the project, it is easier to estimate which tasks need to be done for the mid-term and final reports. The estimated duration of these tasks also was much easier to estimate. The Gantt chart has been updated to contain all tasks set in the \ac{WFD}s. Special care was taken to make sure the Gantt chart is consistent with the \ac{WFD}s and the \ac{WBS}s.
This time the simulator tasks were not separated from the rest of the project because the simulator is more involved with the 
rest of the project for the mid-term and final reports.
The updated Gantt chart can be found in appendix \ref{ganttChart}, page \pageref{ganttChart}.

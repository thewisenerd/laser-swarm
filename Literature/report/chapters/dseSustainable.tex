The aim of the project is to determine the feasibility of a single emitter, multiple detector laser ranging swarm of satellites. This concept could allow the use of a smaller laser emitter, reducing the total weight of the satellite, hence reducing the size of the launcher and the total emission of green house gases during launch. If the individual satellites within the swarm are small enough it would also be possible to piggyback all, or most, satellites on other launchers. 

If one of the satellites is lost (during launch or during operation), the mission can still continue allowing efficient use of the resources used, although the quality of the measurements decreases. In case a unique component in the swarm fails or too many components fail, it is still possible to send a replacement or have a backup satellite, while still using the working components initially launched.

Because all individual satellites will require a separate ADCS, propellant consumption could be higher compared to a regular satellite, so a close eye will have to be kept on this to keep this to a minimum.

Final decommissioning of the swarm will be more complex than for a regular satellite, since every individual satellite has to be decommissioned separately.
